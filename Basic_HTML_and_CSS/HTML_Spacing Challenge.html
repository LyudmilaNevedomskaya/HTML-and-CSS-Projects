		<p>Frogs are amazing amphibians that can live on land and water, and have <span>over 5,000 species worldwide</span>, except in Antarctica.</p>
		<p>Some frogs are highly poisonous, like the golden poison dart frog, whose skin toxin can kill 100,000 people with just one gram.</p>
		<p>Frogs are <span>small animals that can jump very well</span>. Frogs are similar to toads. However, a frog has smooth skin and long legs. A toad has rough skin and shorter legs. Frogs are found throughout the world except in very cold places. They are most common in rain forests. Frogs are amphibians, meaning that they can live in water or on land.</p>
