			<p>Vancouver is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia. The city takes its name from George Vancouver, who explored the inner harbour of Burrard Inlet in 1792 and gave various places British names. Vancouver is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, with majestic mountains, sparkling water, rainforests, and lush greenery in all four seasons.</p>
			<h3>The family name "Vancouver" itself originates from the Dutch "van Coevorden", denoting somebody from the city of Coevorden, Netherlands.</h3>
			<h6>Archaeological records indicate that Aboriginal people were already living in the Vancouver area from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.</h6>
